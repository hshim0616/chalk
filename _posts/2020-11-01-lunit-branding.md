# Lunit INSIGHT



Lunit is a medical AI company devoted to opening a new era of diagnostics and therapeutics using artificial intelligence. Through AI and data-driven medicine, Lunit aims to increase the survival of patients and help physicians provide better care.




The name Lunit is abbreviated from "Learning Unit." Learning is in the core of Lunit's identity and culture—the algorithm and members constantly advance through learning, and we believe there is nothing we can't learn.
The brand identity of Lunit is visualized by a connection of two circles, linked through a diagonal line. It represents the basic unit of the artificial neural network composed of numerous nodes and layers, which further implies the connection between artificial intelligence and medicine.




The brand design of Lunit is based on simple and intuitive transmission of difficult and complicated medical information. For the branded publications, represented by a medical brochure, we highlighted intuitive medical infographics and simple layout to better communicate complicated medical information. We also designated individual yet concerted visual themes—a variation of color and gradient—for each medical area the company focus in.
The gradient artwork visualized the harmony in between the advancing medical system and the relationship between human and artificial intelligence. The positive energy that comes from the overall look and feel represents the corporate identity of Lunit as a company devoted in using advanced technology for the benefit of humanity, sharing acquired knowledge, and creating a meaningful impact on the society.
